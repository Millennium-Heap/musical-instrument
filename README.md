# musical-instrument
This project aims to build a musical instrument controlled by the computer mouse.

### Description
We create a computer program that converts mouse movements into musical pitches.

### Feature
- The instrument would be silent until one of the mouse buttons is held down.
- We can move the mouse up and down to change the pitch.
- We can move the mouse side to side to change the volume.
- If we let go of the mouse button, the musical tone would stop.
